**Biography**:I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Data Storage and Application Lab](http://stlab.wnlo.hust.edu.cn/) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) advised by Prof. Zhipeng Tan. I obtained my M.E. degree in Guidance, Navigation and Control from HUST in 2018, and earned my B.E. degree in Automation from Hunan University in 2015.

Research Interest
======
My research interests include memory management and mobile, which focus on improving user experience via memory management on mobile.

In particular, I have worked on projects that aim to reduce App launch latency, reduce the application lag and solve swap-gc conflict with OS and runtime innovations
. The underlying theme is to design user-friendly memory management on mobile:

1) Accelerate application launch via two-phase prefetching on smartphone
   
2) Memory reclaim strategy based on user behavior and App characteristics
   
3) Re-design Android Runtime and memory management to solve swap-gc conflict
